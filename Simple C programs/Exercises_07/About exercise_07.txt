Exercise 07

a. Write a C program that will help the driver of a truck that deliver and pickup compressedgas cylinders to determine the contents of cylinder based on the color of the cylinder. The 
program will print out a menu colors to be entered. The user should be instructed to 
enter the first letter of the color of tank. Upon reading the letter corresponding to the 
color of the tank, the program will print a message, which states the content of the 
tank. The program should accept the letter in either upper or lower case. Cylinder 
colors associated contents are as follows.

 	Orange ammonia
	Brown Carbon monoxide
	Yellow hydrogen
	Green oxygen

The program should be written using a switch case. Program should print a message prior to 
ending such as ‘Glad to have the service’.

If the user enters a color other than one of the four colors specified in the program, then print 
only the ending message.

b. Modify the same program using nested if-else or if-else-if ladder.
